Next, Open OBS/SLOBS and add a **Text** source. Check "Read from file" and click browse and navigate location that was copied to the clipboard. Select on of the text files for count down, up, or giveaway. That's it! When you start the countdown it will show up!

If you are on macOS when you set click "Browse" in OBS/SLOBS the file picker will come up. To browse to a folder use the following command on your keyboard: (CMD + SHIFT + G) and then paste the directory from My Stream Timer

## Integrating into Stream Deck

You can integrate a **Website** command under **System** to launch My Stream Timer and start a countdown from a specific amount of time. You don't need to browse for a file location at all as you can input a protocol url:

* Count down from X minutes: mystreamtimer://countdown/?mins=6
* Count down to specific time (24 hour clock): mystreamtimer://countdown/?to=15:30
* Count down to top of the hour: mystreamtimer://countdown/?topofhour

## Integrating into Deckboard (using an Extension App for Windows)
If you do not own a Stream Deck but use other apps to control your stream, [Dara Oladapo](https://twitter.com/daraoladapo) created an extension app for Windows that he uses for Deckboard. You can check out the project [here](https://github.com/DaraOladapo/stream-deckboard) and web link [here](https://daraoladapo.github.io/stream-deckboard/).
